# paint-python-
I made a easuy version of paint using pygame and draw in a matrix where you can save you draw change color change the pen size and the cursor ... 

use:
pygame, sys, pynput.mouse, Button, Controller, keyboard, numpy and os

I made a paint graphics desktop app using pygame after seeing the "Tech with Tim" video with the 15 python projects.

If any can tell me why I have problems to convert it in .exe

Otherwise just enjoy
